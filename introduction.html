            Without understanding why and what, it can be difficult to focus on the right things.

            Music has it's own laws and rules, just like there are laws and axioms in math or physics. Unlike the natural sciences though, the rules of music can be bent and changed according to the whims and wishes of the creator - composer. But without understanding these rules the composer is no different from an idiot, who does things without knowing why and is forever under the control of others. To learn these rules means to be in control.

            It is interesting to think about why we call those who write music composers and not simply writers or authors. I believe one of the main reasons for that is because creating music actually means to compose many small ideas and fantasies together into a one larger form. The idea of form is one of the laws that can be bent, but never broken. Form was there since the beginning, since the Seikilos epitaph, through Bach and Beethoven, to Schönberg and Cage.

            The study of music consists of harmony, rhythm, melody, counterpoint, form, orchestration, "tectonics" (originally a Czech term) and many more. Melody can be understood as a part of the counterpoint studies, same with rhythm. Even harmony is very tightly connected to the art of counterpoint, one might even say they are the same, or rather they cannot exist without each other. But the conventional view is that harmony is vertical, counterpoint is horizontal. More on that will be said in each of the individual section of this website.

            People say that the beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Never has something so far from the truth been said so often. They think that just because they find someone attractive when their friends do not, it proves this nonsense phrase. But human attractivity is so much different from true beauty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of American (mostly) TV shows we've heard this again and again, that beauty is subjective. But the word beauty has been raped. The most unnatractive person in the world can, and probably is more beautiful than a hollywood celebrity. And I'm not talking about the cliche inner beauty, that you find so often mentioned on facebook pages of 40 year old moms, or which you hear mentioned in a pub from a man trying to convince his pals about his new girlfriend's attractivity. The truth is that inner and outer beauty cannot exist without each other. If you like Asian culture, it's like Ying and Yang. I've heard that outer beauty is that much more valuable, for how much inner beauty it hides within. It might have been Shakespeare, probably not.
        </p>

            There is of course no doubt that inner beauty is more noble, lasting and precious. But how does this relate to music? Even though the primary language of music is emotion, there are genres that value outer beauty. Pop music is probably the most representative. It gives you immediate emotional gratification, it makes you feel better in the matter of seconds. It cures clinical depression, it cures cancer, it will give you enough courage to go to war. But that's only for a while. If it is a really good pop song, meaybe you can listen to it 50 times until you get bored by it. Of course every average pop star manager knows this. So how does he deal with it? How does he sell the drug he offers as a product, as a piece of meat to be consumed by impressionable teens and adults with hebephilic taste? There are a few tricks in the book. How about a video that goes with the music? A clip that takes more time to make, more money to make, and it makes the music something secondary, just a noisy background for the tribal African dancing of dark skinned "artists" (note the double quotes). Mentioning autotune would be embarassing at this point. But that's how a consumer consumes the product.
