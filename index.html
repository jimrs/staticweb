        <h2>Purpose of this site</h2>
        <p>
            Music has it's own laws and rules, just like there are laws and axioms in math or physics. Unlike the natural sciences though, the rules of music can be bent and changed according to the whims and wishes of the creator - composer.

            It is interesting to think about why we call those who write music composers and not simply writers or authors. I believe one of the main reasons for that is because creating music actually means to compose many small ideas and fantasies together into a one larger form. The idea of form is one of the laws that can be bent, but never broken. Form was there since the beginning, since the Seikilos epitaph, through Bach and Beethoven, to Sch√∂nberg and Cage.

            The study of music consists of harmony, rhythm, melody, counterpoint, form, orchestration, "tectonics" (originally a Czech term) and many more. Melody can be understood as a part of the counterpoint studies, same with rhythm. Even harmony is very tightly connected to the art of counterpoint, one might even say they are the same, or rather they cannot exist without each other. But the conventional view is that harmony is vertical, counterpoint is horizontal. More on that will be said in each of the individual section of this website.
