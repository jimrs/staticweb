            If you're bored of triads in the root position and bass only jumping in fourths or fifths, try treating every voice in the chord like a unique melody on it's own.

        <p>
            For a long time, counterpoint used to be the only education composers would receive. And the rest was left for the pupil to discover on his own. It is not such a bad idea to start with counterpoint study, as you learn something about harmony, form, orchestration, and instrumentation. But this approach can be very demanding on the discipline of the pupil. Because you do not have direct contact with "real" music until you have mastered the whole species counterpoint, which is mainly exercises bound tightly by strict rules. What will help the impatient student is to care very deeply about the <em>meaning</em> of the rules, the reasoning behind them.
