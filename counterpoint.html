        <p>
            If you're bored of triads in the root position and bass only jumping in fourths or fifths, try treating every voice in the chord like a unique melody on it's own.

        <h2>The art of voice leading</h2>

        <p>
            For a long time, counterpoint used to be the only education composers would receive. And the rest was left for the pupil to discover on his own. It is not such a bad idea to start with counterpoint study, as you learn something about harmony, form, orchestration, and instrumentation. But this approach can be very demanding on the discipline of the pupil. Because you do not have direct contact with "real" music until you have mastered the whole species counterpoint, which is mainly exercises bound tightly by strict rules. What will help the impatient student is to care very deeply about the <em>meaning</em> of the rules, the reasoning behind them.
        </p>

        <p>
            The composer should start with a given melody, called "cantus firmus" and try to add another voice to it. He should add a voice above the cantus firmus, and then below the cantus firmus. The ratio of the first species counterpoint exercises is 1:1, which means that for every note of the cantus firmus, a counterpoint of 1 note should be written.
        </p>

        <p>
            The rules are quite simple:
            <ul>
                <li>No dissonances.</li>
                <li>No parallel movement in 5ths or 8ths between voices.</li>
                <li>No voice crossing.</li>
                <li>No tritonus - <em>"Mi against fa, is the devil in musica."</em></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
